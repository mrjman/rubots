# Rubots
This repository will be used to store the code samples and exercises used for the Mondo Rubots learning group.

## Overview
Each meeting will have a separate folder that will contain its own README that will provide information and link to the slides for that presentation. The meeting folders will also contain a samples and exercises folder that will store the code samples used during the meeting.
