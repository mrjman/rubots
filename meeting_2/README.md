## Exercises
For this exercise set we are going to be implementing our own versions of some enumerable methods. You will need to add your implementations to `my_enumerable.rb` and then use your enumerable implementation methods in `quiz.rb`. To run the exercises navigate to `/exercises` directory and run the command `ruby main.rb` and you should see all the tests fail. The goal is to make each test pass.

You can find my answers in `my_enumerable_with_implementation.rb` and `quiz_with_answers.rb` inside the `exercises` directory.
