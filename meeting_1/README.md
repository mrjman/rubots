## Slides
The meeting slides can be found [here](https://slides.com/mrjman/meeting-1)

## Exercises
To run the exerices navigate to either arrays or strings within the exercises directory and run the command `ruby main.rb` and you should see that all tests fail. Your code solutions go in `quiz.rb` in each method. Once you have written your code you can rerun `ruby main.rb` to see if the tests now pass. The `data.rb` file contains the input data set defined as `input` in the `quiz.rb` methods. The `answers.rb` file contains the desired output. Each item in the array within `answers.rb` corresponds to a single test case.

You can find my implementation in the `quiz_with_answers.rb` files within array and string directories. I encourage you to write your own first before looking at the answers I have provided.
